# Machine-Learning-Online-Workshop
In this 3 hours online free workshop we will discuss about everything that you need to learn as a beginner in the field Machine Learning. This is totally FREE and anyone can join. This workshop targets School goers, Undergraduates, Professionals and anyone interested on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep learning or any related fields and the beginners in the field.  Firstt I will introduce you the concepts Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learing and their differences. Then we will discuss about Machine Learning Algorithms and how they work. Thereafter how to apply real world problems to Machine Learning algorithms, how to Train and Evaluate Machine Learning algorithms and finally how to use a trained Machine Learning algorithms to obtain real time predictions. At the last part of the workshop we will train, evaluate and test a machine learning algorithm practically using Python and some other contributed modules.
